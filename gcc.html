GCC is responsible for the core SRKR network. The GCC supports a campus wide 1000 Mbps(Giga Bit) LAN that connects all the academic departments, library and other central facilities to the GCC. Internet access is provided through 24*7 INTERNET connectivity through a 300 Mbps 1:1 leased line and 40 Mbps bundled broadband connection. GCC will provide connectivity to each Department, to the gigabit backbone with 12-core OFC, and also the necessary IP addresses.GCC has installed WLAN on 802.11b/g to allow accessing SRKREC computing resources (Local network and Internet) through the Wireless communication. WLAN is used to provide reliable and proper network connectivity to mobile on-campus users. In each building we have placed the access point in a place which would be most convenient for mobile users. As of now, the campus is installed with 16 access points in various outside locations.
